Given a pattern that is guaranteed to contain only lowercase letters and asterisks, for example 

l*n***f*is**rd*c*l*c**wia**b**y*e*p*uc*n*s*e**s*l*ps**a**s*l

your task is to construct a new string of the exact same length with the letters of the pattern in the same positions, and with each asterisk replaced by any letter of your choice to maximize the total number of positions that contain some five-letter word. For example, one possible answer 

linertfaishardecalackswiaamberyleapsucanesternsclapsesarisel

would score 18 points for the 18 words (liner, inert, shard, decal, alack, lacks, amber, beryl, leaps, canes, ester, stern, terns, claps, lapse, apses, saris, arise) inside it.
